  <!-- We use this file to compile your plugin to your plugins/ directory
       automatically and use the hot swap (also known as live debug) feature.

       It does not support dependencies easily so the only dependency
       we include here is Foundation. It cannot change Foundation's packages
       so you can only debug one plugin at a time to avoid conflicts. -->

  <!-- Ninja: We read pom.xml file to find the Foundation version to use -->

  <!-- Change the name="" key on the top to your plugin's name
       and edit the path below to where your server is located.

       You can simply duplicate the <jar>...</jar> section
       to compile your plugin to multiple servers. -->
